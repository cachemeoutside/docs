## Definition
* Atomic
    * An extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system
    * The source of immense energy or power
* Habit
    * A routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation

## Chapter 1 - The Fundamentals
### The Surprising Power of Atomics Habits
#### Chapter Summary(page 28)
* Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent bettter every day counts for a lot in the long-run
* Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why undesrtanding the details is essential
* Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient
* An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results
* If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead
* You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems
#### My takeaway
* Goals are important as they help set a direction of an outcome to achieve. Although being goal oriented is a double-edged sword as it can result in temporary satisfaction or disappointment. What is important is creating and maintaining the system that creates the outcome.
* "Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves"
* Plateau of Latent Potential
    * Progress is not linear
    * It is important to focus on the system instead of the result. Every subtle change will compound and aggregate into a system that'll help cross the Plateau over time. Expect delays and remain vigilant with atomic improvements
    * Ice cube example, nothing happens at 28, 29, 30, 31 degrees, but when ambient temperature hits 32 degrees, the ice starts melting(i.e. break the plateau)
* Winner and losers have the same goals, but not the same system
* Goals are at odds with long-term progress
    * Once a goal is satisfied, one may drop back to the old system and not preserve the new system that helped achieve the outcome
    * It is all about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement
    * Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress
### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
#### Chapter Summary(page 41)
* There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change
* The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become
* Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
* Becoming the bets version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
* The real reason habits matter is not because theyt can get better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself
#### My takeaway
* Changing habits is challenging for two reasons
    * We try to change the wrong thing
    * We try to change our habits in the wrong way(explained in later chapters)
* 3 layers of behavior change
    * First layer is changing your outcome
    * Second layer is changing your process
    * Third and deepest layer is changing your identity
* Outcome-based habits vs Identity-based habits
    * Example(s)
        * I want to run a marathon vs I want to become a runner
        * I want to read a book vs I want to become a reader
        * I want to learn an instrument vs I want to become a musician
    * To change habits it is important to focus on who we wish to become instead of what we want to achieve
* Identity change can be a double-edged sword
    * One can adopt an identity by repeating a story to yourself repetitively for years. It is easy to trick yourself and accept these as facts over time. These are often hard to over change because you've accepted the "that's who I am" mentality
        * Example(s)
            * I'm terrible with directions
            * I'm not a morning person
            * I'm bad at documentation
* Two step process to changing your identity
    * Your identity emerges out of your habits
    * The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
    * You only believe your identity when you have proof of it
        * If you study for one hour every night, you have evidence that your are studious
        * If you go to the gym regardless of the weather, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness
        * The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it
    * Habits are the path to changing your identity
        * Each time you write a page, you are a writer
        * Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician
        * Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete
        * Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader
        * New identities requires new evidence
    * Process
        * Decide the type of person you want to be
        * Prove it to yourself with small wins
