## Definition
* Atomic
    * An extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system
    * The source of immense energy or power
* Habit
    * A routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation

## Chapter 1 - The Fundamentals
### The Surprising Power of Atomics Habits
#### Chapter Summary(page 28)
* Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run
* Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why undesrtanding the details is essential
* Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient
* An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results
* If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead
* You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems
#### My takeaway
* Goals are important as they help set a direction of an outcome to achieve. Although being goal oriented is a double-edged sword as it can result in temporary satisfaction or disappointment. What is important is creating and maintaining the system that creates the outcome.
* "Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves"
* Plateau of Latent Potential
    * Progress is not linear
    * It is important to focus on the system instead of the result. Every subtle change will compound and aggregate into a system that'll help cross the Plateau over time. Expect delays and remain vigilant with atomic improvements
    * Ice cube example, nothing happens at 28, 29, 30, 31 degrees, but when ambient temperature hits 32 degrees, the ice starts melting(i.e. break the plateau)
* Winner and losers have the same goals, but not the same system
* Goals are at odds with long-term progress
    * Once a goal is satisfied, one may drop back to the old system and not preserve the new system that helped achieve the outcome
    * It is all about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement
    * Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress
### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
#### Chapter Summary(page 41)
* There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change
* The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become
* Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
* Becoming the bets version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
* The real reason habits matter is not because they can get better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself
#### My takeaway
* Changing habits is challenging for two reasons
    * We try to change the wrong thing
    * We try to change our habits in the wrong way(explained in later chapters)
* 3 layers of behavior change
    * First layer is changing your outcome
    * Second layer is changing your process
    * Third and deepest layer is changing your identity
* Outcome-based habits vs Identity-based habits
    * Example(s)
        * I want to run a marathon vs I want to become a runner
        * I want to read a book vs I want to become a reader
        * I want to learn an instrument vs I want to become a musician
    * To change habits it is important to focus on who we wish to become instead of what we want to achieve
* Identity change can be a double-edged sword
    * One can adopt an identity by repeating a story to yourself repetitively for years. It is easy to trick yourself and accept these as facts over time. These are often hard to over change because you've accepted the "that's who I am" mentality
        * Example(s)
            * I'm terrible with directions
            * I'm not a morning person
            * I'm bad at documentation
* Two step process to changing your identity
    * Your identity emerges out of your habits
    * The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
    * You only believe your identity when you have proof of it
        * If you study for one hour every night, you have evidence that your are studious
        * If you go to the gym regardless of the weather, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness
        * The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it
    * Habits are the path to changing your identity
        * Each time you write a page, you are a writer
        * Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician
        * Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete
        * Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader
        * New identities requires new evidence
    * Process
        * Decide the type of person you want to be
        * Prove it to yourself with small wins
### How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
#### Chapter Summary(page 55)
* A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
* The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible
* Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps:
    1. Cue
        * Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior
        * A bit of information that predicts a reward(food, water, money, etc.)
    1. Craving
        * Wants change
        * Differs from person to person
        * Example:
            * You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth
            * You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained
        * Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state
    1. Response
        * The actual habit you perform which can take the form of a thought or an action
        * Response depends on ability. Habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it
            * If you want to dunk a basketball but can't jump high enough, you can't make it a habit
        * Response delivers a reward
    1. Reward
        * First purpose is to satisfy your craving
        * Second purpose is to teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future
            * Brain is a reward detector and is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure
            * Feels of pleasure and dissappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones
* The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are
    1. Cue: Make it obvious
    1. Craving: Make it attractive
    1. Response: Make it easy
    1. Reward: Make it satisfying
#### My takeaway
* The four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit and acts as a feedback loop. In order to successfully break down a habit or create a habit, a behavior in each stage must be sufficient, or else it will not become a habit
* Cue and Craving are the problem, Response and Reward are the solutions
* The inverse of the four laws of behavior change can be used to break a habit
    1. Cue: Make it invisible
    1. Craving: Make it unattractive
    1. Response: Make it difficult
    1. Reward: Make it unsatisfying
* The purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face
### Summary
1. Atomic habits that compound over the long-term is what leads to effective habits that solve your problem
1. It is important to focus on the atomic aspect when building habits as you want incremental improvements
1. Instead of focusing on the results, follow the "Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves" mindset
1. Progress is not linear
1. 3 layers of behavior changes
    * Outcome, process, identity
    * Shift from outcome-based habits to identity-based habits
1. Four Laws of Behavior Change
    * Cue, craving, response, reward
        * All stages must succeed to build an effective habit

## Chapter 2 - The 1st Law
### The Man Who Didn't Look Right
#### Chapter Summary (page 66)
* With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it
* Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing
* The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them
* Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions
* The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior
#### My takeaway
* The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundsing and analyzing the information it comes across.
    * When the brain recognizes a repeated pattern or situation, it will react quicker than the conscious mind
        * Example:
            1. A paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient
            1. A military anaylst seeing a missle on a radar screen
* Pointing-and-Calling is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes
    * Japan railway systems uses this system
    * Can reduce errors up to 85 percents and cuts accidents by 30 percent
    * It's effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. You are more likely to notice problems when using other sensory functions
    * Example:
        * Before going out, check if you have your necessary items:
            * I have my wallet, keys, glasses, mask
            * I locked all windows and balcony doors
* Habits scoreboard
    1. Create a full list of each behavior and ask yourself: Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit
        * Good: +
        * Bad: -
        * Neutral: =
    1. The marks you give to a particular habit will depend  on your sitation and goals
    1. Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex. There are no good or bad habits, there are only effective habits(at solving the problem)
* The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them. This is what makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you
### The Best Way to Start a New Habit
#### Chapter Summary (page 79)
* The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious
* The two most common cues are time and location
* Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location
* The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
* Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit
* The habit stacking formula is: After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT}
#### My takeaway
* Implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. How you intend to implement a particular habit
* People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through
    * Example: I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym
* Habit stacking
    * Diderot effect: obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases:
        * Example: I bought a nice suit, now I need nice shoes, now I need nice socks, etc.
    * Habit stacking uses the Diderot effect in a positive manner by stacking upon existing effective habits:
        * Example(s):
            * You wake up to pour a cup of coffee every morning --> You wake up to pour a cup of coffee every morning and stretch for 5 minutes afterwards
            * Mood: When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering
            * Financial: When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing
* To get started(you can use the Habits Scorecard), create a list with two columns
    * The first column lists habits you do each day without fail
    * The second column lists things that happen to you each day without fail
* Once you have the lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle
### Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
#### Chapter Summary (page 90)
* Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time
* Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out
* Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment
Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue
* It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues
#### My takeaways
* People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are
* Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior
* Kurt Lewin simple equation: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, b =f(P,E)
    * Tried in business world. Impulse buying is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it. They buy it not because they want them, but because of how it is presented
* You don't have to be a victim of your environment, you can also be the architect of it
* Design your environment for success
    * Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out
        * Example: Airport placed a small sticker like a fly near the center of each men's urinal. The stickers "improved their aim" and significantly reduce "spillage" around the urinals. Furhter analysis determined that the stickers cut out bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year
    * The context is the cue
        * One use per space. I.e.
            * Eating only in the dining room
            * Work only in the office room
            * Bed is only for sleeping
        * A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form
### The Secret to Self-Control
#### Chapter Summary
* The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible
* Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten
* People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it
* One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it
* Self-control is a short term strategy, not a long term one
#### My takeaways
* Chapter summary sums up the chapter well
* It is better to spend your time optimizing your environment than creating willpower to change
### Summary
* The 1st law of behavior change is to make it obvious
    * Awareness
    * Cues
    * Acknowledgement
* Implementation intention formula is effective in creating effective habits
* Use the habit stacking technique to create new habits
* Design your environment for success. It is easier to control the environment you spend a significant amount of your time in than your emotions and willpower
* Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out
* Most individuals do not have "self-control". Rather, they choose and design their environments to resist temptation and avoid indulgence
* Motivation is temporary, a stable environment is sustainable

## Chapter 3 - The 2nd Law
### How to Make a Habit Irresistible
#### Chapter Summary (page 111)
* The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive
* The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming
* Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine arises, so does our motivation to act
* It is the anticipation of a reward--not the fulfillment of it-- that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike
* Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do
#### My takeaways
* Dopamine-driven feedback loop
    * You can like something, but if you don't have the desire(dopamine), you won't want it
    * When dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act
    * It is the anticipation of a reward that gets us to take action
* Use temptation bundling to make your habits more attractive
    * Example
        * Write a computer program that would allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed
    * Stack with habit stacking formula:
        1. After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
        1. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].
        1. Example:
            1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I'm grateful for(need)
            1. After I say one thing I'mgrate for, I will read the news(want)
* Making a habit truly irresistible is a hard task, but can temptation bundling is a simply strategy than can make it more attractive in a effective manner
### The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping your Habits
#### Chapter Summary (page 122)
* The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us
* We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe
* We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close(family and friends), the many(the tribe), and the powerful(those with status and prestige)
* One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group
* The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves
* If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive
#### My takeaways
* The seductive pull of social names
    * Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in and bond with others
    * we don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them
    * We imitate from these 3 groups in particular
        1. The close
        1. The many
        1. The powerful
1. The close
    * Surrounding yourself with others who exhibit habits that you want to adopt will more likely help you establish an effective habit
        * Example: Going to the gym regularly with a friend committed to fitness will put peer pressure on you to keep up and imitate your friend because you view them as a success
1. The many
    * This can be a double-edged sword as it can lead to an inaccurate or doubtful response. You may succumb yourself to peer pressure per societal norms
    * In other ways, this can be a good thing because you want to believe and want to fit in with the culture(i.e. if the neighborhood is mowing their own regularly, you don't want to be the oddball out, but you want to be part of the community norm)
1. The powerful
    * We want to imitate successful people because we ultimately want to succeed ourselves
### How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
#### Chapter Summary (page 133)
* The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive
* Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive
* Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires
* The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. Thpe reidction leads to a feeling
* Highlight the benefits of avoinding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive
* Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit
#### My takeaways
* Make and bad habits unattractive and acknowledge the association that creates it
* Where cravings come from
    * Common underlying motives of humans
        1. Conserve energy
        1. Obtain food and water
        1. Find love and reproduce
        1. Connect and bond with others
        1. Win social acceptance and approval
        1. Reduce uncertainty
        1. Achieve status and prestige
    * A manifestation of a deeper underlying motive
        * You don't want to smoke, but you want to relieve anxiety and reduce uncertainty
        * You don't want to post on instagram, but you want social accpetance and approval
* How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits
    * Make more attractive by learning to associate them with a positive experience
    * Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift
    * Word choice matters in terms of helping you feel bettter
        * Example:
            * You have to wake up early for work --> You get to wake up early for work
            * You have to exercise --> You get to walk with your partner after dinner
    * These associations can become motivation rituals that becomes a cue
        * Example: I associated listening to music to help calm my anxiety. I listen to music before playing my tennis game
### Summary
* The 2nd law of behavior change is to make it attractive
* The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming
* It is the anticipation of a reward that gets us to action, not the fulfillment of it
* Use a combination of temptation bundling and habit stacking to make your habits more attractive
* Humans are herd animals and can be influenced by peer pressure and societal norms
* We imitate the close, the many, and the powerful
* Surrounding yourself with the like-minded individuals whom you want to imitate will likely help accelerate and establish your habit
* Make bad habits unattractive and acknowledge what bad habits are exhibited from your behavior
* Identify what underlying motives are associated with a particular habit
* Reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits
    * Word choice and mindset matters to get yourself to feel better and make change more attractive
